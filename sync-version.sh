#!/bin/bash
#
# sync-version.sh - Propagate the Realtek driver version everywhere from a single
# source of truth (versions.yml).
#
# Why this exists:
#   The build itself already reads versions.yml directly
#   (build.sh -> build_driver.sh / build_qpkg.sh), so the COMPILED driver, the
#   PACKAGED QPKG version and the Web UI version always match versions.yml at build
#   time. This script keeps the *committed* human-facing copies (package manifest
#   default, web UI, README, developer guide) from drifting, so a version bump is a
#   single command instead of editing ~9 files by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   ./sync-version.sh            # re-sync all references to the current versions.yml
#   ./sync-version.sh 2.21.5     # bump versions.yml to 2.21.5 AND propagate everywhere
#   NEW=2.21.5 ./sync-version.sh # same as above
#
# NOTE: The driver's internal release DATE (shown by `modinfo`, e.g. "2025/10/28")
#       lives inside the Realtek source and is only known after download/build. It is
#       deliberately NOT tracked here - read it from the built module if you need it.

# 3) Free-text references: replace the previous exact version string. Using the full

#    or QTS (5.2.3) versions. Skipped on a pure re-sync (OLD == NEW).
